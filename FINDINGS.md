# semi-git — v1 findings

Status: the v1 vertical slice is built and verified end-to-end against the real
OpenAI backend. A user can modify a codebase at the **intent/feature level** and
plug features in and out cleanly.

## What works (verified)

- **Intent → valid code.** `sgt do "<intent>"` classifies the prompt, delegates to
  the OpenAI coding backend (typed effects via structured output), gates the result
  through the EICO confluence check, and lands it as a feature node. The generated
  code is invariant-valid and runnable, and matches the stated intent (e.g. a 6-char
  md5 URL shortener). Verified via `scripts/e2e_smoke.py` and the `sgt` CLI.
- **Clean plug-out.** Reverting an independent feature removes exactly that feature
  and leaves the rest of the codebase invariant-valid and runnable.
- **Dependency-aware revert (closure).** When feature B calls a function defined by
  feature A, the dependency is inferred from the call graph; reverting A removes B
  too, so no dangling caller is ever left behind. Support-kind nodes (concept /
  infrastructure) are garbage-collected when orphaned; capabilities are not.
- **Never leaves broken code.** Every revert re-materializes from the remaining
  active effects and is gated by the invariant predicate before commit.
- **Iterate on an existing feature (`modify` → `replace_def`).** `sgt modify` re-derives
  a body change in place: the backend emits a `replace_def` that rewrites an existing
  function (one definition, no same-named duplicate) rather than appending a new unit.
  A `replace_def` whose new body calls another feature forms a dependency edge, so
  revert closure stays correct. Verified via `scripts/e2e_modify.py`.
- **Git underneath.** Each operation materializes the working tree and commits, with
  a `Sgt-Node-Id` trailer mapping commits to semantic nodes (survives amend/rebase).

The canonical state function is the replay of active nodes' effect-bundles from
empty — which is what makes "drop a feature and re-materialize" sound.

## Parallel fan-out + continuous confluence (verified)

- **One intent fans out (#2).** `sgt "<multi-part intent>"` runs a decomposition agent
  that emits a transient constraint graph of sub-tasks (intent + provides/needs +
  depends-on), topo-layered into coordination-free batches. A checkpoint confirms a
  >1-task plan (`--yes` / auto-confirm skips it); an atomic intent runs inline. Verified
  via `scripts/e2e_fanout.py`: "validate + normalize + register email" decomposed into
  2 parallel sub-tasks + 1 dependent, all landed as nodes, dependency edges inferred
  from the call graph, and `register_email` composed the two correctly.
- **Layers dispatch concurrently.** Each independent layer runs through a thread pool
  (backend calls are blocking I/O); a dependent layer is dispatched against the
  post-land tree, so it sees its providers' code.
- **Continuous confluence is real (#3).** Held effects are no longer silently dropped:
  they become durable `QUARANTINED` nodes (excluded from materialization) carrying a
  witness (which invariant/effect, and why). A bounded, non-blocking auto
  rewrite-to-commute re-dispatches the held task against post-land state — when the
  conflict was an ordering issue, it lands; when not, it stays pending and the run still
  completes. Quarantines participate in revert closure.

## Observations

- The intake classifier exercises real judgment: "add `short_link` that calls
  `shorten`" was sometimes routed as a **refinement of the shortener capability**
  (merged into one node) and sometimes as a **separate capability depending on it**.
  Both are correct; they differ only in revert granularity. This is the
  system-distilled-graph behavior working as intended.

## Fan-out reliability follow-ups (from code review, deferred)

These are known, lower-severity items surfaced by an adversarial review pass; the
fan-out path is sound without them (the confluence gate is always the backstop):

- **Rewrite-to-commute budget vs. transient failures.** A backend error during
  `attempt_rewrite_to_commute` consumes a commute attempt and the witness reason can be
  stale (gate reason, not "backend failed"). Should distinguish transient backend
  failures from genuine non-commutation, with a small backoff.
- **No per-task dispatch timeout / `BaseException` handling.** A hung backend call blocks
  the layer (`ThreadPoolExecutor.shutdown(wait=True)`); `KeyboardInterrupt` is not caught
  as a failed task. Relies on the OpenAI client's own request timeout today.
- **Reshape (R31) is via quarantine+rewrite, not edge re-layering.** A planner
  under-serialization (dependent placed in its provider's layer) is held and reconciled
  against post-land state — safe, but `ConstraintGraph.add_dependency` is not invoked by
  the loop. The explicit add-edge/re-layer path remains future work.
- **Witness label for `add_call` conflicts** names the enclosing function, not the callee.
- **Fan-out commit carries no node trailer** (it spans multiple landed nodes), so
  `node_id_for_commit` returns None for fan-out commits (unlike the serial path).

## Known v1 limitations (deferred, see the plan)

- **Effects are function-granular** (`add_def` / `replace_def` / `add_import` /
  `set_const` / `rename_def` / `add_call`). `replace_def` rewrites a whole top-level
  function; sub-function edits (changing one statement, splitting a function) are
  still expressed as a full-def replacement, not a finer-grained patch.
- **Per-file invariants.** Reference integrity is checked per file; cross-module
  import resolution is shallow (an imported name is treated as defined).
- **Single language** (Python AST), per plan KTD3.
- **Gardener** (auto split/merge/relabel) and the **quarantine/reconciliation UI**
  are minimal in v1: conflicting effects are held back and reported, not yet
  re-written to commute. Multiverse, the confluence corpus, RL training, and the
  Codex/Gemini backends are deferred.
